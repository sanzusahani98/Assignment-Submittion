//         Question 1
//Question 1
By how many ways we can access elements in the DOM and write about them in brief?
 and write about them in brief?

 answer- There are 3 way can access element in DOM
 ID
 var salsMotto = document.getElementById("IdName");
 The Document method getElementById() returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string. Since element IDs are required to be unique if specified, they're a useful way to get access to a specific element quickly.

 class
 var teamMembers = document.getElementsByClassName("ClassName");
 he getElementsByClassName method of Document interface returns an array-like object of all child elements which have all of the given class name(s). When called on the document object, the complete document is searched, including the root node. You may also call getElementsByClassName() on any element; it will return only elements which are descendants of the specified root element with the given class name(s).


 Tagname
 document.getElementsByTagName()
 The getElementsByTagName method of Document interface returns an HTMLCollection of elements with the given tag name. The complete document is searched, including the root node. The returned HTMLCollection is live, meaning that it updates itself automatically to stay in sync with the DOM tree without having to call document.getElementsByTagName() again.

// Question 2
// Write a javascript program that will take 2 numbers from the HTML page and display them on the
// HTML page after the addition of those 2 numbers.


function addition(){
    var x,y,z;
    x=Number(document.getElementById ('first).value')
    y=Number(document.getElementById ('second').value')
    z=x+y

}


    </script>
    enter the First number : <input type="text" id="first">
    enter the second number : <input type="text" id="second">
    <button onclick='addition()'>Add</button>
